After the success of the very [first HackerHouse Taiwan](/blog/hackerhouse-taiwan/feb-2024) in February 2024 in Taipei, I quickly knew I wanted to do another one!

There were two goals I had in mind for the second edition:

1. To invite more local folks to join the fun \o/
2. To show folks a bit more of Taiwan than just Taipei

I pitched this idea to [Anita Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anita-chen-5ab12754/) from the [DIGI Gold Card Community](https://www.linkedin.com/company/digigoldcard/), and she and her awesome team from [Taipei Computer Association](https://www.linkedin.com/company/taipeicomputerassociation/) and [Startup Terrace Kaohsiung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/startup-terrace-kaohsiung-86ba7523a/) were excited about the plan and instrumental in making it happen! Thank you so much [Victor Kawaguti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorkawaguti/), [Veronica Yuting Tsai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronica-yuting-tsai/), and [Dana Liu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/preedananliu/) for all your help! ðŸ«¶

## Why Kaohsiung?

Kaohsiung is the second largest city in Taiwan, and is known for its beautiful beaches, delicious food, and rich history.

More importantly, however, it's more laid back, more spacious, and more affordable than Taipei. And, as an added bonus, its climate in December is still nice and sunny. All these factors were crucial in creating a good experience for a larger group of people.
